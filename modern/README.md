This is a new version of the Traccar web app. It is still in a very early stage of development.

It uses [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) and [React-Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/), which is a wrapper around [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/). Feedback and contributions are welcome.

To run the project in development mode:

- Make sure you have Traccar back-end running locally on port 8082
- Install dependencies using `npm install` command
- Run development server using `npm start` command

Project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). For more information see [user guide](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
